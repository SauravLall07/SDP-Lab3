# Guestbook: containerisation lab

A small guestbook web app. Visitors enter their name, number of visitors, date and length of stay, a 0–5 star review and a comment. Previous entries are listed in a table (name, date, review, and the comment cut to 32 characters). Clicking an entry opens its full details in a panel that slides in from the right.

The app is already written. **Your job is to containerise it**: write a `Dockerfile` for the app and a compose file that runs the app together with a PostgreSQL database.



**Q1 (multiple choice).** What does Docker do?

- a) Tracks versions of your source code
- b) Packages an application with its dependencies and runs it in isolated containers
- c) Emulates a full physical computer, including its hardware, to run another operating system
- d) Bundles and minifies JavaScript for the browser

**Q2.** Why do we use Docker Compose instead of plain `docker run` commands?

**Q3.** What command starts all the containers defined in a compose file?

**Q4.** What command stops and removes those containers?

## Tech stack

- [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit) (Svelte 5, TypeScript), built with Vite and served by Node through [`@sveltejs/adapter-node`](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-node)
- PostgreSQL, accessed with the [`postgres`](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) driver

## How to run it

### Configuration

The app is configured entirely through environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | | `postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/DBNAME` |
| `PORT` | no | `3000` | Port the server listens on |
| `HOST` | no | `0.0.0.0` | Interface the server binds to |

The app creates its own `entries` table on startup (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`), so you never need to run SQL by hand. If the database isn't reachable yet, the app logs `database not ready … retrying` and keeps trying in the background.

### Development

```sh
npm install
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/guestbook npm run dev
```

The dev server runs at http://localhost:5173.

### Production build

```sh
npm ci                  # install exact dependencies from package-lock.json
npm run build           # compile into build/
npm prune --omit=dev    # optional: drop build-only dependencies
node build              # start the server (listens on $PORT, default 3000)
```

At runtime, the server needs only the `build/` directory, the production `node_modules` and `package.json`. None of the source code or dev dependencies are needed.

### Diagnostic endpoint

`GET /api/marking-test` returns JSON describing the running API (`version`, `node`, `env`, `hostname`, `in_container`) and its database connection (`connected`, `host`, `server_version`, `database`, `user`, `table_exists`, `entry_count`, `write_ok`, …). It returns HTTP 200 with `"status": "ok"` when everything works, and HTTP 503 with `"status": "error"` and an error message when the database can't be reached. This makes it a useful endpoint to healthcheck against.

## Supported Node versions

**Node 20.19+, 22.12+ or 24+.** For example `node:20-alpine`, `node:22-alpine`, `node:24-alpine` or `node:lts-alpine`.

The project enforces this: `.npmrc` sets `engine-strict=true`, so `npm ci` refuses to install on any other version, including `node:18` and odd-numbered releases like `node:23`. It fails with an `EBADENGINE` / `notsup` error, and your image build fails with it.

## Supported PostgreSQL versions

**PostgreSQL 14 or newer**, using the official `postgres` image (e.g. `postgres:16`, `postgres:17-alpine`, `postgres:18-alpine`).

Where the image keeps its data changed in version 18:

| Image | Mount the data volume at |
| --- | --- |
| `postgres:14` – `postgres:17` | `/var/lib/postgresql/data` |
| `postgres:18` and newer | `/var/lib/postgresql` |

Postgres 18+ refuses to start if a volume is mounted at the old `/var/lib/postgresql/data` path. Many older tutorials use that path.

## Lab requirements

### What you hand in

- `Dockerfile`
- `compose.yml` (or `compose.yaml` / `docker-compose.yml` / `docker-compose.yaml`)

Put both in the root of this repository. If you'd rather keep them in a subdirectory, that works too, as long as your compose file's `build.context` / `build.dockerfile` point at the app and your Dockerfile. The automarker follows those settings, just as Docker does.

### Requirements

You choose the service names, database name, credentials, volume names and host port. Your stack must:

1. Define **two services**. One builds this app from your `Dockerfile` (it has a `build:` key). The other runs the official `postgres` image.
2. Give the app a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable of the form `postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/DBNAME`. The app listens on `PORT` (default `3000`).
3. Publish the app's port to the host so the site is reachable in a browser.
4. Keep the guestbook's data when the stack is stopped and started again with `docker compose down` / `docker compose up`.
5. Start reliably. The app should not come up before the database is ready to accept connections.

## Running the automarker

`automark.sh` builds and starts your stack, tests it and tears it down again. This is the script your submission is marked with.

### Prerequisites

- Docker with Compose v2 (`docker compose`, not `docker-compose`)
- `curl`
- `jq` (`brew install jq` / `apt install jq`)
- The host port your compose file publishes must be free.

### Usage

```sh
./automark.sh                  # mark the Dockerfile + compose file in this directory
./automark.sh --keep           # same, but leave the stack running afterwards so you can explore it
./automark.sh path/to/dir      # mark a submission in another directory
./automark.sh --help
```

| Environment variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PROJECT` | `automark` | Compose project name used for the test stack |
| `TIMEOUT` | `90` | Seconds to wait for the app to become ready |
| `BASE_URL` | discovered | Test against this URL instead of the discovered host port |

The automarker runs its stack under its own project name. It starts from a clean slate (`docker compose down -v` for that project) and removes the containers and volumes again when it finishes, unless you pass `--keep`.

The automarker doesn't depend on your naming choices. It finds your **app service** as the one with a `build:` key, and your **database service** as the one whose `image` is `postgres` (e.g. `postgres:17-alpine`, `docker.io/library/postgres:16`). It finds the app's URL from the first published port of the app service.

### The tests

Each check prints `PASS`, `FAIL`, `WARN` or `SKIP`. Stages 1–7 are **required checks**. Stage 8 contains **good-practice checks**, which only produce warnings.

If something essential fails, the automarker stops early and prints the last 40 lines of container logs. Examples are a missing published port, a failed build, the stack not starting, or the app never becoming ready.

**Stage 1: Static checks.** These run before anything is built.

| Check | Passes when |
| --- | --- |
| Compose file exists | There's a `compose.yaml`, `compose.yml`, `docker-compose.yaml` or `docker-compose.yml`. |
| Compose file is valid | `docker compose config` accepts it. *Stops the run if not.* |
| Defines exactly two services | The compose file has two services: the app and the database. |
| App service is built from the Dockerfile | Exactly one service has a `build:` key. |
| Dockerfile exists | The Dockerfile that the app service builds from exists. Its path comes from `build.context` + `build.dockerfile` (default `Dockerfile`) in your compose file. |
| Database service runs a postgres image | Exactly one service's `image` is the `postgres` image. If none matches, this and the other checks that need the database service are *skipped*, not failed. |
| App publishes a port to the host | The app service has a `ports:` entry with a published host port. *Stops the run if not.* |

**Stage 2: Build and start**

| Check | Passes when |
| --- | --- |
| Images build | `docker compose build` succeeds. *Stops the run if not* (the build output is shown). |
| Stack starts | `docker compose up -d` succeeds, including any `depends_on` conditions. *Stops the run if not.* |
| Marking-test reports ok within 90s | `GET /api/marking-test` returns HTTP 200 with `"status": "ok"` within `TIMEOUT` seconds. *Stops the run if not.* |

**Stage 3: Marking-test endpoint.** These check the JSON from `/api/marking-test`.

| Check | Passes when |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP 200 with status ok | `status` is `"ok"`. |
| API runs inside a container | `api.in_container` is `true`, meaning the process is running in a Docker container. |
| API runs with NODE_ENV=production | `api.env` is `"production"`. The app container must have `NODE_ENV=production` set. |
| Database connected | `database.connected` is `true`. |
| Postgres major version >= 14 | `database.major` is 14 or higher. |
| Entries table exists | The app created its `entries` table. |
| Database accepts writes | A test row can be inserted and read back (inside a transaction that's rolled back, so no data is left behind). |
| App reaches the database over the compose network | The host in `DATABASE_URL` isn't `localhost`, `127.x.x.x`, `::1` or `host.docker.internal`. |
| App's database is the postgres container | The database server the app is connected to has the same IP address as your database service's container. This proves the app is using *your* database container. |

**Stage 4: App smoke test.** A real entry is submitted through the site's form handler.

| Check | Passes when |
| --- | --- |
| Form submission succeeds | Posting the guestbook form (with a unique marker name) returns success. |
| Home page lists the new entry | The marker name appears on the home page. |
| Entry count increased by one | `entry_count` from marking-test went up by exactly 1. |

**Stage 5: Persistence across `docker compose down` / `up`.** The whole stack is taken down *without* `-v`, so volumes are kept, and started again.

| Check | Passes when |
| --- | --- |
| Stack comes back after down/up | Marking-test reports ok again within `TIMEOUT`. |
| Entry count preserved | `entry_count` is the same as before the stack was taken down. |
| Smoke-test entry still listed | The stage 4 entry is still on the home page. |

If the stack doesn't come back, the other two checks fail as "not checked".

**Stage 6: Restarting the whole stack.** `docker compose restart` is run for the whole project.

| Check | Passes when |
| --- | --- |
| Marking-test ok after restart | Marking-test reports ok again within `TIMEOUT`. |
| Data intact after restart | `entry_count` is unchanged. |

**Stage 7: Restarting only the database.** Only the database service is restarted. The app is left running.

| Check | Passes when |
| --- | --- |
| API reconnects after the database restarts | Marking-test reports ok again within 45 seconds. The app has to reconnect on its own. |

This check is skipped if the database service couldn't be identified in stage 1.

**Stage 8: Good practice (warnings only).** These never fail a run, and they're reported separately from the score.

| Check | Passes when (otherwise WARN) |
| --- | --- |
| App runs as a non-root user | `id -u` inside the app container isn't `0`. |
| App image is small | The app image is 300MB or smaller. |
| No database credentials baked into the app image | The image's own environment (from `ENV` in the Dockerfile) doesn't contain `DATABASE_URL` or a password. Set these in compose instead. |
| App declares depends_on | The app service has a `depends_on`. |
| Database defines a healthcheck | The database service has a `healthcheck`, so `depends_on` can wait until it's ready. |
| Database port is not published to the host | The database service has no `ports:`. Only the app needs to reach it. |
| Database data uses a named volume | The database service mounts a named volume. |
| `.dockerignore` excludes node_modules | The `.dockerignore` Docker actually uses lists `node_modules`. That's `<Dockerfile>.dockerignore` next to the Dockerfile if present, otherwise `.dockerignore` at the root of the app's build context. A `.dockerignore` anywhere else is ignored by Docker, and by this check. |

### Scoring

The run ends with a summary:

```
Required checks: 28/28 passed (100.0%)
Good practice:   8/8 (0 warnings)
```

- **Required checks** covers stages 1–7, a total of 28 checks. The percentage is `passed / 28`. Checks that never ran because the automarker stopped early count as not passed.
- **Skipped** checks are only possible when the database service can't be identified by its image (3 checks). They're left out of the total and listed on a `Skipped:` line.
- **Good practice** is reported separately and doesn't affect the percentage.
- The script exits with status `0` only if every required check passed.
